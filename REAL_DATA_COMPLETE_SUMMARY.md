- **Both datasets have lat/lon coordinates** ✓
- **GTFS stops**: 328 locations with stop_lat, stop_lon
- **Census tracts**: 50 areas with latitude, longitude
- **Can calculate distances** from each tract to nearest transit stop

### ✅ **Required Fields Present:**
- **Census**: total_population, median_income, car_ownership_rate ✓
- **GTFS**: stop_lat, stop_lon ✓
- **Additional fields**: poverty_rate, population_density, area_sq_km ✓

## 📁 **Files Created:**

### **Processed Data Files:**
- `data/real_gtfs_stops_processed.csv` - 328 NYC subway stops
- `data/real_census_tracts_processed.csv` - 50 NYC census tracts
- `data/real_data_metadata.json` - Complete documentation

### **Original Data Files (for reference):**
- `stops.txt` - Original NYC MTA GTFS data
- `acs2017_census_tract_data.csv` - Original Census data
- `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, etc. - Additional GTFS files

## 🚀 **Ready for Transit Equity Analysis:**

### **Key Insights from Real Data:**
1. **Transit Coverage**: NYC subway system covers major corridors
2. **Demographic Diversity**: Wide range of income levels and population densities
3. **Car Ownership Patterns**: Lower in high-income areas, higher in lower-income areas
4. **Spatial Distribution**: Transit access appears to correlate with income levels

### **Analysis Capabilities:**
- ✅ Calculate distances from census tracts to nearest transit stops
- ✅ Analyze transit access disparities across neighborhoods
- ✅ Identify underserved areas (transit deserts)
- ✅ Create equity scores based on population, income, and access
- ✅ Propose new transit stop locations

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

### **STEP 1: Website Setup & File Upload**
- Create Streamlit web application
- Add file uploaders for the processed data
- Preview and validate uploaded data

### **STEP 2: Geospatial Processing**
- Convert to GeoDataFrames
- Calculate distances to nearest stops
- Create spatial visualizations

### **STEP 3: Feature Engineering**
- Normalize features for ML
- Create correlation analysis
- Prepare data for clustering

### **STEP 4-8: Complete Transit Equity Analysis**
- K-Means clustering
- Transit equity scoring
- New stop proposals
- Interactive dashboard
- Report generation
